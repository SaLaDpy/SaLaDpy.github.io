SpringSaLaD [software](https://vcell.org/ssalad) is built with a user-friendly 
GUI supporting model creation, running simulations, and data collection. 
It is available for download for Mac, Unix, and Windows platforms.

The current package is most suitable for modeling mesoscopic systems, which are far 
too large to be modeled with molecular dynamics but which require more detail 
than obtainable with macroscopic continuum models. In SpringSaLaD,

SpringSaLaD supports the full array of typical biochemical reactions: 
zeroeth-order reactions which model particle creation, a variety of 
first-order reactions such as particle decay, dissociation, and state transitions, 
and second-order reactions between sites for bonding reactions.

A good example of a system which is best modeled with SpringSaLaD is ligand-mediated 
receptor clustering, where coarse-grained particle-level interactions are required 
but atom-level information is not of interest. In general, SpringSaLaD is best used 
to model mesoscopic particles (diameters of 1 – 10 nm, which could represent a functional 
protein domain), moderately sized systems (10 – 10,000 particles), and times scales 
on the order of 1 second, but no actual restriction is set on size or scale of the 
simulated system.
